Biggest-Animated-DS-Visualizer

AI-powered C++ platform to visualize, animate, and explore core data structures with interactive, exportable workflows.

This project is an all-in-one data structure visualizer built in C++ and SFML. It brings classic data structures to life with live animations, interactive exploration, and exportable visuals. Currently included are BSTs, Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists — with Graphs and Hash Tables coming soon.

The goal is to make data structures easier to understand by seeing how they work step by step in an interactive, visual environment. Whether you’re learning, teaching, or testing algorithms, this platform provides a clear, hands-on way to understand the workflow of each structure.

⚠️ Work in Progress: Files are being uploaded gradually. Stay tuned for more data structures and complete workflows.
